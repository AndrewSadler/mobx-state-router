Motivation: Decouple State and UI

Features
--------
- Decoupled state from UI
- Router state consists of path parameters and query parameters
- Central route configuration in one file
- Ability to fetch data before a component starts rendering
- Ability to prevent going to the requested URL based on the application state. For example, redirect to the signin page if the user is not logged in. 
- Support for 404 (Not Found)
